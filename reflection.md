- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded all of the constructors to create blank houses, libraries, and cafes.
I overloaded the constructor again in House to create a house without knowing its address. I didn't really feel like any of the other methods had obvious ways to be overloaded that would actually be helpful, and I don't know any of the addresses for the houses so it seemed useful.
I overloaded printCollection in Library to print only the available books or only the checked out books because when I browse books at a library I like to seem only what's available. 
I overloaded sellCoffee to just sell a black coffee, although I don't think this is a better solution than just making a sellBlackCoffee method. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think I was a little bit confused about some of the wording in this assignment. As far as I can tell goToFloor already takes you directly to a floor, so when we assume that all libraries have elevators I don't think we need to override that method within the Library class. I only overrided it in House and Cafe, assuming I interpreted that correctly.
